# Progress

## What Works
- Spring Boot backend project structure is set up and running
- Model classes for exchange rate data are implemented
- Repository interface and in-memory implementation are working
- Service layer for business logic is implemented
- Controller layer with RESTful endpoints is implemented
- Integration with Frankfurter API for current exchange rate data is working
- Caching mechanism for exchange rate data is implemented
- Scheduled tasks for real-time updates are working
- Error handling and logging for API requests are implemented

## What's Left to Build
- Test the historical data endpoint with the Frankfurter API
- Implement the Angular frontend
- Create components for displaying exchange rate data
- Implement charts for visualizing historical data
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Add unit tests for backend components
- Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Add user authentication (if required)
- Deploy the application

## Current Status
The backend is now successfully fetching current exchange rate data from the Frankfurter API. We've switched from the Yahoo Finance API to the Frankfurter API due to authentication issues with the former. The application is able to fetch, process, and cache exchange rate data, and provide it through RESTful endpoints.

## Known Issues
- None at the moment, but we need to thoroughly test the historical data endpoint

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Initially planned to use Yahoo Finance API for exchange rate data
2. Encountered authentication issues with Yahoo Finance API
3. Tried Exchange Rate API (exchangerate.host) but had issues with the response format
4. Successfully switched to Frankfurter API (api.frankfurter.app)
5. Implemented caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
6. Added scheduled tasks for real-time updates
7. Implemented proper error handling and logging for API requests
